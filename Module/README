Installation instructions for the rt61 Module


==================
Build Instructions
==================

For 2.4 or 2.6 series kernel:

a. Unpack the driver sources:
     $ tar -xvzf rt61-x.x.x.tar.gz

b. Go to Module directory:
     $ cd ./rt61-x.x.x/Module

c. Compile the driver sources:
     $ make

d. Install the driver module (as root):
     # make install


==============================
Installation of firmware files
==============================

In order for the rt61 driver to function correctly the correct firmware file
needs to be installed in /lib/firmware (note however that some linux distros
rather use /lib/firmware/<KERNEL_VERSION> as their default firmware location).

     $ cp *.bin /lib/firmware

Alternatively, the firmware files can be downloaded from the Ralink web-site
(http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm), and manually installed in
/lib/firmware.

The mapping of the firmware files is as follows:
  - rt2561.bin    Ralink rt2561 chipset
  - rt2561s.bin   Ralink rt2561turbo chipset
  - rt2661.bin    Ralink rt2661 chipset.


=============
Configuration
=============

RT61 driver can be configured via following interfaces, 
i.e. (i)"iwconfig" command, (ii)"iwpriv" command, (iii) configuration file

i)  iwconfig comes with kernel.  
ii) iwpriv usage, please refer to file "iwpriv_usage.txt" for details.


=================
Misc. information
=================

If you want for rt61 driver to auto-load at boot time:

A) choose wlan0 for first RT61 WLAN card, wlan1 for second RT61 WLAN card, etc.
   
B) create(edit) 'ifcfg-wlan0' file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/,      
   edit(or add the line) in /etc/modules.conf:
       alias wlan0 rt61        
   
C) edit(create) the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-wlan0  
   DEVICE='wlan0'
   ONBOOT='yes'     

NOTE:
   if you use dhcp, add this line:
     BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
   in the file ifcfg-wlan0.

*D) To ease the Default Gateway setting, 
    add the line
    GATEWAY=x.x.x.x   
    in /etc/sysconfig/network
