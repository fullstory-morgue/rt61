NOTE: This driver at this point in time is largely untested.

It basically consists of the base rt61 driver code released by Ralink with
a number of assorted fixes out of the rt2500 tree applied. More fixes need
to be brought over from the rt2500 tree before this driver can be considered
"beta-quality"

Use this driver at your own risk.

See the file <Module/TESTING> with more information on how you can help us
with testing this driver.
